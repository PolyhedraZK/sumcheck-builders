## Past Talks

- Simon Lau from Polyhedra: a presentation on his recent work in accelerating SumChecks using GPUs. Simon is a researcher specializing in efficient hardware and computer architectures. He will share his latest findings and benchmark results, comparing the performance of both CUDA and Triton frameworks in this context
  - Friday, October 18, 10:00 AM PST / 1:00 PM EST / 7:00 PM CET
  - [Recording]()

- Vishruti (cryptography at %) will be talking about an optimization (dubbed &#34;Beta Cascade&#34;) to the prover&#39;s sumcheck evaluation function over multilinear extensions of the form $V(g) = \sum_z \beta(g, z) * f(z)$ (where $f$ is nonlinear in each of the $z_i$&#39;s), as is used in GKR over circuits with &#34;structured&#34; wiring patterns. In particular, Beta Cascade boasts an $O(2^n)$ per-sumcheck-round runtime ($n$ = number of &#34;free&#34; variables within the MLE), while requiring only $O(n)$ memory (vs. $O(2^n)$ for a &#34;beta table&#34; of evaluations) and an &#34;update&#34; step of $O(n)$ (vs. $O(2^n)$ for the &#34;beta table&#34; approach).

- Tiancheng from Polyhdera team is going to talk about Pianist.
    - Friday, Sept 27, 1 PM PT/ 4 PM ET / 10 PM CET
    - Abstract:  Blockchain technology has grown rapidly, but scalability remains a major challenge. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), especially zkRollups, offer solutions but often require massive resources. In this talk, we introduce a fully distributed approach to ZKP generation using multiple machines with minimal communication. Built on the Plonk system, our protocols can be used as a **recursive proof system**, significantly reducing prover time and resource demands, offering a more scalable solution for blockchain applications.
